Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module
to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to
libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you
are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an
extension or command language for that application. By the way, the language is named after the BBC show 
“Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits 
in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged! Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want
to examine it in some more detail. Since the best  way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you
to play with the Python interpreter as you read. In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are 
explained. This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples shown later.
The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples,
beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally
touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.
