#so far we have concluded how to express the 4 operations in math by using PYTHON 3.9.5
#Now we will move on to something to the power of something e.g.: 3 to the power of 5 = 3x3x3x3x3
#i npython, the _to_ we use it as: _**_ so example 5 to 6 in math and in python difference:
#IN MATH: 5 to the power of 6
#IN CODE: 5**6
